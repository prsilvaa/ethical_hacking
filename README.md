<h1><a href="https://github.com/prsilvaa"> Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing</a></h1>

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>As a penetration tester, my goal was to identify vulnerabilities in a network that could allow attackers to steal or access sensitive company data. I carried out scanning, exploitation, password cracking, and vulnerability analysis using professional tools to assess the networkâ€™s security and demonstrate potential risks.</p>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Nmap</li>
    <li>Metasploit Framework</li>
    <li>John the Ripper</li>
    <li>Armitage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skills Gained</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Network Scanning</li>
    <li>Exploitation Techniques</li>
    <li>Password Cracking</li>
    <li>Vulnerability Assessment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>I successfully completed a comprehensive penetration test on a server at college. During the assessment, I identified several critical vulnerabilities including a poorly configured firewall, multiple open ports, unprotected sensitive files, and weak, easily guessable passwords. These weaknesses could potentially allow unauthorized access and data theft. Based on these findings, I provided detailed recommendations to improve network security by properly configuring the firewall, closing unnecessary ports, securing confidential files, and enforcing strong password policies to help prevent future data breaches.</p>

<h2>Lab Progress</h2>

<h3>Lab 1: Kali Networking</h3>
<p>Learned how to create networks and configure network adapters. I enjoyed setting up networking but found adding vmnet2 necessary for connectivity as a challenge.</p>

<h3>Lab 2: Nmap & EC-Target</h3>
<p>Learned how to exploit a machine using Nmap for scanning. Enjoyed identifying open ports. Challenge: Making the target machine work properly.</p>

<h3>Lab 3: Metasploitable</h3>
<p>Learned to exploit vulnerabilities using Legion tool. Enjoyed seeing Legion in action. Challenge: Following unclear lab instructions.</p>

<h3>Lab 4: Windows XP Reverse Shell</h3>
<p>Learned how to view files inside a target machine using commands like 'dir' and 'type'. Enjoyed gaining access to target machine data. Challenge: Incorrect lab notes.</p>

<h3>Lab 5: Hashcat & Armitage</h3>
<p>Learned password cracking using RockYou dictionary and managing sessions via Armitage. Enjoyed cracking passwords. Challenge: Finding correct passwords.</p>
