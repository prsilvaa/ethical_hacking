<h1><a href="https://github.com/prsilvaa"> Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing</a></h1>

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>As a penetration tester, my goal was to identify vulnerabilities in a network that could allow attackers to steal or access sensitive company data. I carried out scanning, exploitation, password cracking, and vulnerability analysis using professional tools to assess the networkâ€™s security and demonstrate potential risks.</p>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Nmap</li>
    <li>Metasploit Framework</li>
    <li>John the Ripper</li>
    <li>Armitage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skills Gained</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Network Scanning</li>
    <li>Exploitation Techniques</li>
    <li>Password Cracking</li>
    <li>Vulnerability Assessment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>I successfully completed a comprehensive penetration test on a server at college. During the assessment, I identified several critical vulnerabilities including a poorly configured firewall, multiple open ports, unprotected sensitive files, and weak, easily guessable passwords. These weaknesses could potentially allow unauthorized access and data theft. Based on these findings, I provided detailed recommendations to improve network security by properly configuring the firewall, closing unnecessary ports, securing confidential files, and enforcing strong password policies to help prevent future data breaches.</p>
